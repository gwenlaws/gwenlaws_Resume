I struggled with getting the css grid to work. I had extra parenthesis around the columns declaration, getting rid of them fixed the problem right away. I could not figure out how to properly link fonts, but it was explained to me and i fixed the probelm. I unfortunately could not figure out how to animate anything to put it on the page.
